# Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

Canalyst

* When was the company incorporated?

2015

* Who are the founders of the company?

Damir Hot and James Rife

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

One of the company’s founders, James Rife, was an analyst at Fidelity and built the first version of the company’s analytics tools for his own personal use. Interest from institutional investors in that initial product led him to found the company.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

The company is funded by venture capital and merchant banking over three rounds totalling $26.2M.  

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Canalyst primarily addresses two issues associated with financial modelling: time/labour cost and breadth of available data.The former helps investors increase the efficiency of their research process while the latter allows them to make more informed decisions when investing in small and mid-cap equities. Elsewhere, the accuracy of their models, based directly on company filings is trustworthy and dynamic, updated quarterly when new data is released and/or when a restatement is issued, or a major merger or acquisition occurs. By developing a library of financial models ranging across 4000+ North American companies, valuation metrics, margin analysis and revised income statements, they allow investors to access more data, more efficiently, in ready-to-use formats, through the cloud, lowering the cost of doing such research independently.       

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

In general, Canalyst might be used by anyone interested in investing in North American companies. This might include financial analysts, portfolio managers, institutional investors, retail traders, CIOs and Directors, and many more. It would be hard to determine the market size of this set of customers because it ranges across several specific domain segments of the larger financial industries, including but not limited to asset managers within wealth management, professional trading, and investment banking.   

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

The company offers a one-stop shop for all of an asset managers fundamental data needs. The advantage they leverage is the price at which they are able to make this data available for asset managers and the ease of use in applying this data to investors’ research process. Canalyst does not purport to have a specific technological advantage over their competitors, that is they do not promote a proprietary method of analyzing fundamental data, but rather a superior user experience when dealing with familiar financial models, one that is cost effective, broad, accurate, reliable and uniform. They are a contractor for research that would traditionally be done in-house.  

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company's engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Canalyst uses cloud technologies to deliver financial data primarily in Excel (more recently in any format that their clients need) to take advantage of a subscription-based business model. 

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

The company’s market spans the investment management and wealth management domains. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

There have been a huge number of innovations in the financial research tools space in the last 5-10 years. These include, broadly, innovations in AI, big data and cloud computing. Major trends and innovations include implications of macro technological and economic trends like increased access to low-cost cloud computing, advances in natural language processing, and greater reliance on algorithmic trading strategies. In general, these have amounted to a high level of competition to provide alternative financial information - that is, information gathered from big data drawn from today’s massive and ever increasing media landscape. Interestingly, Canalyst is not focused on this trend, but rather what this trend is leaving behind: fundamental financial data. This strategy reflects an antithetical approach to current trends within institutional investing and poses a topical question - should investment strategies still be buffered or underlined by fundamental data or can they proceed exclusively on the basis of financial information?

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

Competitors include companies focused on sentiment analytics like AlphaSense and Sentifi, companies that straddle both sentiment and traditional data sources like Sentieo, and direct competitors like S&P Capital IQ. 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

In 2020, Canalyst signed its 200th firm client and since its inception in 2015 has gone from $2M to $26 and $28M in funding, with a team of 100+ spread across offices in Vancouver, BC and, as of 2018, Manhattan, NY.   

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Some of the core metrics used to evaluate companies in this domain are annual revenues, number of employees, total funding and quality of CEO. According to Owler, Canalyst is being led by a high quality CEO (84/100 performance score) in Damir Hot, but has not produced significant revenues despite having increased their funding 10-fold over the last 5 years. The company seems to be emerging as opposed to mature. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Canalyst is quite small compared to some of its competitors, notably AlphaSense and Sentieo whose estimated annual revenues are $14.4M and $10M respectively, with only 70 more employees each, though their CEO is ranked comparatively higher.  

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I believe that significant increases in the retail trading market present a lucrative opportunity for Canalyst. In 2020, retail trading made up 25% of the stock market’s activity compared to just 10% in 2019, no doubt because of the growing interest from new, COVID-affected retail traders. A fundamental data analytics tool built with these new traders in mind could garner broad interest from retail traders who are modelling their strategies on those of well known, highly visible trading legends like Warren Buffet, William O’Neil and Michael Burry. Leveraging their current business model - subscription based - against this massive and growing new market could be a reliable way to scale the company.   

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Expanding on their B2B model to include B2C would significantly increase the company’s potential market reach and could be done utilizing their existing technologies, but under a wholly separate brand identity. This way, they could leverage work they have already done against an entirely separate market while maintaining the ‘professionals-only’ feel of their current product. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

The product itself - financial models - could all be based on the technologies the company already utilizes: cloud software, data processing and data visualization. In addition, they might build a UX that is more suitable for less sophisticated traders. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

Most retail traders are operating on the bases of market indicators and only a small amount of fundamental and sentiment analysis. A UX that makes applying fundamental data analysis approachable and less time consuming would be attractive for part-time or amateur investors.
